## about:
This project is Leo Drake's attempt at recreating the popular literary game "wordle". A game which tests users knowledge on the English language and the ability to decipher the correct word with as little attempts as possible.


## how to play.
Select letters using the displayed keyboard.
Once a 5 letter word is completes the row, press the submit button.
If the word that is selected is correct each letter box will go green.
If a letter is in the word but in the wrong place the box will go yellow.
If the letter is not in the word the keyboard letter will go red, which indicates that it is not in the word.

## rules

Word must be a 5 letter word. If word isn't in word list then user will be prompted to type in something else until word is in word list. user has 6 attempts until each row is filled up. if it is the 6th row and the submitted answer is incorrect. then you have lost the game.


## process

I decided to make most of my project using functions so that it would be easier to recall once a user decides they want to replay the game.



## limitations 

In the case that a user has put multiple letters of the same word. but there is only 1 of such letter in word. multiple of the letters will go yellow, which may give the impression there are multiple rather than just the 1 letter in the word.
minor sizing problems with keyboard when window is small. 


## extensions 

It would be nice to save the previous word used in a game so that when a user restarts although its a small chance but it prevents a word from being chosen twice.
